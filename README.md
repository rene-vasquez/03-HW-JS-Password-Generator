# 03-HW-JS-Password-Generator

Big thank you to Stephen K. for helping on this HW.
Shout out to Danny Yates as well for providing help
We collaborated on this assignment on 3/31

We essentially split the user input using the "split" function

If the user included a character that correlated with one of our arrays it would list a new variable as true

If that variable was true then it would add that array to our empty "choiceCharacters" array to generate a password from

From then it takes the length input from the passwordLength prompt and generates a password using that number of characters.
